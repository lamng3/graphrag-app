His spectral visitation to Scrooge serves as a pivotal moment in the narrative, warning Scrooge about the dire consequences of his greed in the afterlife. Marley's intervention is not limited to his own visit; he is also responsible for sending the second of three spirits to further guide Scrooge towards moral redemption. This act of posthumous aid underscores Marley's concern for Scrooge's well-being beyond their earthly partnership. Marley had previously predicted the visitation of these ghosts, indicating a premeditated plan to help Scrooge confront and amend his ways. Scrooge, reflecting on these events, is grateful to Marley, presumably for providing him with the opportunity to change his life's course. Through Marley's actions, both in life and death, he emerges as a crucial figure in Scrooge's journey towards understanding the true value of compassion and human connection.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 269, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
