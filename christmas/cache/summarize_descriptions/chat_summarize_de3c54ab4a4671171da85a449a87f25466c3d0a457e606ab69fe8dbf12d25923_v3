Among these visions, the most poignant is the sight of Scrooge's own neglected grave, a powerful image that underscores the theme of mortality and the consequences of a life lived without compassion or connection to others. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come is characterized by its silent, ominous presence, serving as a representation of the shadows of things which yet may happen. Unlike the other spirits that visit Scrooge, this ghost does not speak, instead allowing the stark realities of the potential future to speak for themselves. Through its haunting revelations, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come plays a pivotal role in Scrooge's eventual redemption, illustrating the importance of empathy, community, and the possibility of change, even for someone as seemingly irredeemable as Ebenezer Scrooge.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
