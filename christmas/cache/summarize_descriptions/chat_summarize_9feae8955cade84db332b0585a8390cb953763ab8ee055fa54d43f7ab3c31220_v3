Initially, Scrooge's concern for Tiny Tim emerges after being confronted by the Ghost about the child's potential fate, highlighting a pivotal moment in Scrooge's journey towards empathy and compassion. This concern deepens into a significant emotional connection, especially as Scrooge is affected by the notion of Tiny Tim's death, which underscores the depth of his change of heart. The impact of Tiny Tim's condition, alongside the broader circumstances of the Cratchit family, plays a crucial role in catalyzing Scrooge's transformation. Although the text does not explicitly detail every moment of Scrooge's shift in perspective, it is clear that Tiny Tim and the Cratchit family's situation profoundly influence Scrooge, leading him to reevaluate his life and priorities.
