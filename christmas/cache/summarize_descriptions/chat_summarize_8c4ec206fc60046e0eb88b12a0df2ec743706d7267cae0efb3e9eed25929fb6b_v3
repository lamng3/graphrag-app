Marley was Scrooge's business partner, and their partnership was significant enough that Scrooge was Marley's sole executor and mourner upon his death. Marley has been deceased for seven years, yet his presence continues to influence Scrooge's life. This enduring connection is highlighted by the supernatural occurrences that Scrooge experiences, such as seeing Marley's ghostly face appear to him. The haunting is not just a literal ghostly visitation but also a metaphorical haunting, as Scrooge is frequently reminded of Marley, even imagining his face on the tiles around him. This suggests that Marley's memory and their shared past weigh heavily on Scrooge, affecting his present life. The relationship between Scrooge and Marley is thus characterized by both their past business dealings and the lingering impact of Marley's death on Scrooge's psyche.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 443, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
