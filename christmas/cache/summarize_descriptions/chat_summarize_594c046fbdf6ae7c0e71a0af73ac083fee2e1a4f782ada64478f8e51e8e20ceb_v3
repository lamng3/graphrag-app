It stands as a testament to the power of volunteerism and philanthropy, aiming to promote free access to literature for everyone. The collection includes a wide array of eBooks, among which \"A Christmas Carol\" is notably featured, showcasing the diversity and cultural significance of the works available. Project Gutenberg operates under a unique model where some profits derived from the works, when applicable, are donated to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. This not only supports the maintenance and expansion of the library but also ensures the sustainability of its mission to increase the number of public domain and licensed works distributed in machine-readable form. The success and ongoing operation of Project Gutenberg are made possible by the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and the generous donations from people in all walks of life. This collaborative effort has made Project Gutenberg synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works, accessible in formats readable by the widest variety of computers, thereby democratizing access to literature and knowledge worldwide.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
