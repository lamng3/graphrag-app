Her activities are not just limited to the passive presence in this den of thievery; she actively participates by selling a variety of items that she has likely pilfered. The inventory of goods she deals in is quite extensive, encompassing sheets, towels, wearing apparel, silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and boots. This assortment suggests that Mrs. Dilber is not only opportunistic but also indiscriminate in the items she chooses to steal and sell, targeting anything from personal clothing to household items and silverware. Her actions, deeply entwined with the shadowy operations of Old Joe's shop, paint a picture of a character who is unscrupulous in her pursuit of profit, exploiting the possessions of others, possibly including those of Scrooge, to enrich herself.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 391, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
