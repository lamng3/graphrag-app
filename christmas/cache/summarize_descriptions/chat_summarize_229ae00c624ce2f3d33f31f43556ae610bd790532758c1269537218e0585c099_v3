Their relationship is characterized by tension, primarily due to Scrooge's initial reluctance to grant time off for Christmas, reflecting his miserly and unsympathetic nature. Despite these challenges, Bob Cratchit remains a loyal and kind-hearted employee, demonstrating his goodwill by toasting to Scrooge's health on Christmas Day, even when Scrooge's actions have negatively impacted his family.\n\nScrooge's behavior and decisions significantly affect Bob Cratchit's family, who struggle under the weight of Scrooge's frugality and lack of empathy.
