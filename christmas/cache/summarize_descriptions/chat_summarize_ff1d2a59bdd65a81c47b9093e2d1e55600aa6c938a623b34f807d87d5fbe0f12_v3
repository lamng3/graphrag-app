It involves the apparition of Jacob Marley's ghost, who appears to Ebenezer Scrooge. This spectral visitation serves as a crucial warning to Scrooge about the consequences of his miserly and unkind ways. Jacob Marley, Scrooge's former business partner, returns from the afterlife to caution Scrooge about the dire fate that awaits him if he does not change his ways. Marley's ghostly visit is not only a forewarning of Scrooge's potential doom but also a prelude to the subsequent visits from three spirits. These spirits are destined to guide Scrooge through a transformative journey, offering him a chance at redemption. Thus, Marley's Ghost sets the stage for the unfolding of the story's central themes of reflection, redemption, and the possibility of change.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0, "text_tokens": null, "image_tokens": null}}, "service_tier": "default"}}}
